## CSS Refactored
1. Regouped the .search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing classes as they shared the same css. 
2. Regrouped the .benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost classes as they also shared the same CSS. 
3. Moved .search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing up in the CSS to fit where it was being implemented in the HTML. 
4. Utilized the main section in order to use same css elements across images in main.
5. Removed unnecessary CSS after regrouping classes.
